# Mentally Friendly - Full Stack Developer Test

## The Problem

Diplay the results from a simulated feed (see data.json taken from Vimeo) onto a page and provide functionality to select a set of those results to be added to a playlist that can be later retrieved in that user session. You should not have to use a database for this.

## Requirements

You are expected to take the approach of using Test Driven Development (TDD) for both the front-end and back-end components.

The final result should have a back-end that uses this data feed and serves this to a front-end built with something like Vue.js, React, Angular 2, etc.

The approach to the solution is up to you to decide, but we ask the back-end be developed using Laravel.

The final solution should contain a lightweight Dockerfile - A Dockerfile has been provided that should achieve this. When you are finished with this test, push your docker image containing your production code to https://hub.docker.com/ and provide us a link to this image. Please fork this repository and commit your solution there.
